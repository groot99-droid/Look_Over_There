// Guns and ammo. Each player may carry one gun, found in a locker on B1 (a locker is opened once); ammo packs lie on every floor and are taken once.
// A gun starts with GUN_ROUNDS, a pack adds PACK_ROUNDS, and nobody carries more than MAX_ROUNDS. Shared by the server (rooms) and the game (solo play).
// AFK Beacons lie on every floor too (BEACONS each), taken once, at most MAX_BEACONS carried. A locker also holds a cloak: whoever opens it gets both.
// A floor's state is {lockers: [0|id], packs: [0|id], beacons: [0|id]}: 0 = still there, otherwise the id of the player who took it.
